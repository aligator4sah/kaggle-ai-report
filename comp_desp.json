  "title": "Human Protein Atlas - Single Cell Classification",
    "short_description": "Find individual human cell differences in microscope images",
  "description": "There are billions of humans on this earth, and each of us is made up of trillions of cells. Just like every individual is unique, even genetically identical twins, scientists observe differences between the genetically identical cells in our bodies.\n\nDifferences in the location of proteins can give rise to such cellular heterogeneity. Proteins play essential roles in virtually all cellular processes. Often, many different proteins come together at a specific location to perform a task, and the exact outcome of this task depends on which proteins are present. As you can imagine, different subcellular distributions of one protein can give rise to great functional heterogeneity between cells. Finding such differences, and figuring out how and why they occur, is important for understanding how cells function, how diseases develop, and ultimately how to develop better treatments for those diseases.\n\nTo see more, start with less. That may seem counterintuitive, but the study of a single cell enables the discovery of mechanisms too difficult to see with multi-cell research. The importance of studying single cells is reflected in the ongoing revolution in biology centered around technologies for single cell analysis. Microscopy offers an opportunity to study differences in protein localizations within a population of cells. Current machine learning models for classifying protein localization patterns in microscope images gives a summary of the entire population of cells. However, the single-cell revolution in biology demands models that can precisely classify patterns in each individual cell in the image.\n\nThe Human Protein Atlas is an initiative based in Sweden that is aimed at mapping proteins in all human cells, tissues, and organs. The data in the Human Protein Atlas database is freely accessible to scientists all around the world that allows them to explore the cellular makeup of the human body. Solving the single-cell image classification challenge will help us characterize single-cell heterogeneity in our large collection of images by generating more accurate annotations of the subcellular localizations for thousands of human proteins in individual cells. Thanks to you, we will be able to more accurately model the spatial organization of the human cell and provide new open-access cellular data to the scientific community, which may accelerate our growing understanding of how human cells functions and how diseases develop.\n\nThis is a weakly supervised multi-label classification problem and a code competition. Given images of cells from our microscopes and labels of protein location assigned together for all cells in the image, Kagglers will develop models capable of segmenting and classifying each individual cell with precise labels. If successful, you'll contribute to the revolution of single-cell biology!\n\nThe scientific journal Nature Methods is interested in considering a paper discussing the outcome and approaches of the challenge. The Human Protein Atlas team, led by Professor Emma Lundberg, would like to invite top performing teams to join as co-authors in writing this paper. Please follow the discussion forum for more details on how you can help.",

  "title": "Cassava Leaf Disease Classification",
  "short_description": "Identify the type of disease present on a Cassava Leaf image",
  "description": "As the second-largest provider of carbohydrates in Africa, cassava is a key food security crop grown by smallholder farmers because it can withstand harsh conditions. At least 80% of household farms in Sub-Saharan Africa grow this starchy root, but viral diseases are major sources of poor yields. With the help of data science, it may be possible to identify common diseases so they can be treated.\n\nExisting methods of disease detection require farmers to solicit the help of government-funded agricultural experts to visually inspect and diagnose the plants. This suffers from being labor-intensive, low-supply and costly. As an added challenge, effective solutions for farmers must perform well under significant constraints, since African farmers may only have access to mobile-quality cameras with low-bandwidth.\n\nIn this competition, we introduce a dataset of 21,367 labeled images collected during a regular survey in Uganda. Most images were crowdsourced from farmers taking photos of their gardens, and annotated by experts at the National Crops Resources Research Institute (NaCRRI) in collaboration with the AI lab at Makerere University, Kampala. This is in a format that most realistically represents what farmers would need to diagnose in real life.\n\nYour task is to classify each cassava image into four disease categories or a fifth category indicating a healthy leaf. With your help, farmers may be able to quickly identify diseased plants, potentially saving their crops before they inflict irreparable damage.",

    "short_description": "Detect diabetic retinopathy to stop blindness before it's too late",
    "description": "Imagine being able to detect blindness before it happened.\n\nMillions of people suffer from diabetic retinopathy, the leading cause of blindness among working aged adults. Aravind Eye Hospital in India hopes to detect and prevent this disease among people living in rural areas where medical screening is difficult to conduct. Successful entries in this competition will improve the hospital’s ability to identify potential patients. Further, the solutions will be spread to other Ophthalmologists through the 4th Asia Pacific Tele-Ophthalmology Society (APTOS) Symposium\n\nCurrently, Aravind technicians travel to these rural areas to capture images and then rely on highly trained doctors to review the images and provide diagnosis. Their goal is to scale their efforts through technology; to gain the ability to automatically screen images for disease and provide information on how severe the condition may be.\n\nIn this synchronous Kernels-only competition, you'll build a machine learning model to speed up disease detection. You’ll work with thousands of images collected in rural areas to help identify diabetic retinopathy automatically. If successful, you will not only help to prevent lifelong blindness, but these models may be used to detect other sorts of diseases in the future, like glaucoma and macular degeneration.",

    "short_description": "Determine if two products are the same by their images",
    "description": "Do you scan online retailers in search of the best deals? You're joined by the many savvy shoppers who don't like paying extra for the same product depending on where they shop. Retail companies use a variety of methods to assure customers that their products are the cheapest. Among them is product matching, which allows a company to offer products at rates that are competitive to the same product sold by another retailer. To perform these matches automatically requires a thorough machine learning approach, which is where your data science skills could help.\n\nTwo different images of similar wares may represent the same product or two completely different items. Retailers want to avoid misrepresentations and other issues that could come from conflating two dissimilar products. Currently, a combination of deep learning and traditional machine learning analyzes image and text information to compare similarity. But major differences in images, titles, and product descriptions prevent these methods from being entirely effective.\n\nShopee is the leading e-commerce platform in Southeast Asia and Taiwan. Customers appreciate its easy, secure, and fast online shopping experience tailored to their region. The company also provides strong payment and logistical support along with a 'Lowest Price Guaranteed' feature on thousands of Shopee's listed products.\n\nIn this competition, you’ll apply your machine learning skills to build a model that predicts which items are the same products.\n\nThe applications go far beyond Shopee or other retailers. Your contributions to product matching could support more accurate product categorization and uncover marketplace spam. Customers will benefit from more accurate listings of the same or similar products as they shop. Perhaps most importantly, this will aid you and your fellow shoppers in your hunt for the very best deals.",

    "title": "RANZCR CLiP - Catheter and Line Position Challenge",
    "short_description": "Classify the presence and correct placement of tubes on chest x-rays to save lives",
    "description": "Serious complications can occur as a result of malpositioned lines and tubes in patients. Doctors and nurses frequently use checklists for placement of lifesaving equipment to ensure they follow protocol in managing patients. Yet, these steps can be time consuming and are still prone to human error, especially in stressful situations when hospitals are at capacity.\n\nHospital patients can have catheters and lines inserted during the course of their admission and serious complications can arise if they are positioned incorrectly. Nasogastric tube malpositioning into the airways has been reported in up to 3% of cases, with up to 40% of these cases demonstrating complications [1-3]. Airway tube malposition in adult patients intubated outside the operating room is seen in up to 25% of cases [4,5]. The likelihood of complication is directly related to both the experience level and specialty of the proceduralist. Early recognition of malpositioned tubes is the key to preventing risky complications (even death), even more so now that millions of COVID-19 patients are in need of these tubes and lines.\n\nThe gold standard for the confirmation of line and tube positions are chest radiographs. However, a physician or radiologist must manually check these chest x-rays to verify that the lines and tubes are in the optimal position. Not only does this leave room for human error, but delays are also common as radiologists can be busy reporting other scans. Deep learning algorithms may be able to automatically detect malpositioned catheters and lines. Once alerted, clinicians can reposition or remove them to avoid life-threatening complications.\n\nThe Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists (RANZCR) is a not-for-profit professional organisation for clinical radiologists and radiation oncologists in Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore. The group is one of many medical organisations around the world (including the NHS) that recognizes malpositioned tubes and lines as preventable. RANZCR is helping design safety systems where such errors will be caught.\n\nIn this competition, you’ll detect the presence and position of catheters and lines on chest x-rays. Use machine learning to train and test your model on 40,000 images to categorize a tube that is poorly placed.\n\nThe dataset has been labelled with a set of definitions to ensure consistency with labelling. The normal category includes lines that were appropriately positioned and did not require repositioning. The borderline category includes lines that would ideally require some repositioning but would in most cases still function adequately in their current position. The abnormal category included lines that required immediate repositioning.\n\nIf successful, your efforts may help clinicians save lives. Earlier detection of malpositioned catheters and lines is even more important as COVID-19 cases continue to surge. Many hospitals are at capacity and more patients are in need of these tubes and lines. Quick feedback on catheter and line placement could help clinicians better treat these patients. Beyond COVID-19, detection of line and tube position will ALWAYS be a requirement in many ill hospital patients.",

    "short_description": "Register two images from different viewpoints",
    "description": "For most of us, our best camera is part of the phone in our pocket. We may take a snap of a landmark, like the Trevi Fountain in Rome, and share it with friends. By itself, that photo is two-dimensional and only includes the perspective of our shooting location. Of course, a lot of people have taken photos of that fountain. Together, we may be able to create a more complete, three-dimensional view. What if machine learning could help better capture the richness of the world using the vast amounts of unstructured image collections freely available on the internet?\n\nThe process to reconstruct 3D objects and buildings from images is called Structure-from-Motion (SfM). Typically, these images are captured by skilled operators under controlled conditions, ensuring homogeneous, high-quality data. It is much more difficult to build 3D models from assorted images, given a wide variety of viewpoints, lighting and weather conditions, occlusions from people and vehicles, and even user-applied filters. Google employs Structure-from-Motion techniques across many Google Maps services, such as the 3D models created from StreetView and aerial imagery. In order to accelerate research into this topic, and better leverage the volume of data already publicly available, Google presents this competition in collaboration with the University of British Columbia and Czech Technical University.\n\nIn this code competition, you’ll create a machine learning algorithm that registers two images from different viewpoints. With access to a dataset of thousands of images to train and test your model, top-scoring notebooks will do so with the most accuracy.\n\nIf successful, you'll help solve this well-known problem in computer vision, making it possible to map the world with unstructured image collections. Your solutions will have applications in photography and cultural heritage preservation, along with Google Maps. Winners will also be invited to give a presentation as part of the Image Matching: Local Features and Beyond workshop at the Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) in June.",

    "description": "When selling used goods online, a combination of tiny, nuanced details in a product description can make a big difference in drumming up interest. And, even with an optimized product listing, demand for a product may simply not exist–frustrating sellers who may have over-invested in marketing.\n\nAvito, Russia’s largest classified advertisements website, is deeply familiar with this problem. Sellers on their platform sometimes feel frustrated with both too little demand (indicating something is wrong with the product or the product listing) or too much demand (indicating a hot item with a good description was underpriced).\n\nIn their fourth Kaggle competition, Avito is challenging you to predict demand for an online advertisement based on its full description (title, description, images, etc.), its context (geographically where it was posted, similar ads already posted) and historical demand for similar ads in similar contexts. With this information, Avito can inform sellers on how to best optimize their listing and provide some indication of how much interest they should realistically expect to receive.",

    "short_description": "Identify melanoma in lesion images",
    "description": "Skin cancer is the most prevalent type of cancer. Melanoma, specifically, is responsible for 75% of skin cancer deaths, despite being the least common skin cancer. The American Cancer Society estimates over 100,000 new melanoma cases will be diagnosed in 2020. It's also expected that almost 7,000 people will die from the disease. As with other cancers, early and accurate detection—potentially aided by data science—can make treatment more effective.\n\nCurrently, dermatologists evaluate every one of a patient's moles to identify outlier lesions or “ugly ducklings” that are most likely to be melanoma. Existing AI approaches have not adequately considered this clinical frame of reference. Dermatologists could enhance their diagnostic accuracy if detection algorithms take into account “contextual” images within the same patient to determine which images represent a melanoma. If successful, classifiers would be more accurate and could better support dermatological clinic work.\n\nAs the leading healthcare organization for informatics in medical imaging, the Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine (SIIM)'s mission is to advance medical imaging informatics through education, research, and innovation in a multi-disciplinary community. SIIM is joined by the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC), an international effort to improve melanoma diagnosis. The ISIC Archive contains the largest publicly available collection of quality-controlled dermoscopic images of skin lesions.\n\nIn this competition, you’ll identify melanoma in images of skin lesions. In particular, you’ll use images within the same patient and determine which are likely to represent a melanoma. Using patient-level contextual information may help the development of image analysis tools, which could better support clinical dermatologists.\n\nMelanoma is a deadly disease, but if caught early, most melanomas can be cured with minor surgery. Image analysis tools that automate the diagnosis of melanoma will improve dermatologists' diagnostic accuracy. Better detection of melanoma has the opportunity to positively impact millions of people.",

    "description": "Bengali is the 5th most spoken language in the world with hundreds of million of speakers. It’s the official language of Bangladesh and the second most spoken language in India. Considering its reach, there’s significant business and educational interest in developing AI that can optically recognize images of the language handwritten. This challenge hopes to improve on approaches to Bengali recognition.\n\n\n\nOptical character recognition is particularly challenging for Bengali. While Bengali has 49 letters (to be more specific 11 vowels and 38 consonants) in its alphabet, there are also 18 potential diacritics, or accents. This means that there are many more graphemes, or the smallest units in a written language. The added complexity results in ~13,000 different grapheme variations (compared to English’s 250 graphemic units).\n\nBangladesh-based non-profit Bengali.AI is focused on helping to solve this problem. They build and release crowdsourced, metadata-rich datasets and open source them through research competitions. Through this work, Bengali.AI hopes to democratize and accelerate research in Bengali language technologies and to promote machine learning education.\n\nFor this competition, you’re given the image of a handwritten Bengali grapheme and are challenged to separately classify three constituent elements in the image: grapheme root, vowel diacritics, and consonant diacritics.\n\nBy participating in the competition, you’ll hopefully accelerate Bengali handwritten optical character recognition research and help enable the digitalization of educational resources. Moreover, the methods introduced in the competition will also empower cousin languages in the Indian subcontinent.",
